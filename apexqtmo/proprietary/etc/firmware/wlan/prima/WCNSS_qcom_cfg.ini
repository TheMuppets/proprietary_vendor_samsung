# The EDET threshold mapping is as follows in 3dB step:

# 0 = -60 dBm

# 2 = -66 dBm

# ...

# 7 = -81 dBm

# 8 = -84 dBm

# Note: Any of these settings are valid. Setting 0 would yield the highest power saving (in a noisy environment) at the cost of more range. The range impact is approximately #calculated as:

#

#  Range Loss  (dB)  =  EDET threshold level (dBm) + 97 dBm.
